                            <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
                            <p>The most crucial part of organ donation after it’s available is to instantly find a donor and securely transfer it. The introduction of the machine to machine communication where all of these devices communicate without any human interference ensuring fast actions. It includes services that provide convenience to the device owners and along with that conduct certain transactions. Theyhavetomaintain track and maintain track of them as well. Already implementedsituationsuse blockchains for tracking all of these transactions without compromisingthesecrecy of the data of the owner and also to prevent the risk of fraud and also keep its integrity intact for medical legal requirements. The health services where e-government applications, TeleMedicine and Artificial Intelligence have been reviewed.</p>
                            
                            <p>The effects of sharing of the data about patients and diseases among health sector parties through smart contracts have been investigated. Blockchain technology will eliminate inefficiency and will also cause a reduction of costs by conducting transactions among parties without central authority through smart contracts. Everything could be tied to a blockchain ledger containing verifiable time-stamped records of creation and ownership. These systems could also be used to transfer value between users, detect changesin documents, or prevent data tampering. This has proven to be a very trusted way of transfer entities such as organs via a trustworthy platform. According to NASSCOM, blockchain-led increase in productivity and cost reduction can create a valueof upto USD 5 billion dollars in the Indian economy by 2023. India has some of the most sophisticated uses of blockchain in some areas. For instance, one of the most advanced applications of blockchain to store property records known to date can be found in AP.</p>
                            <h2>Organ Donation</h2>
                            <p>Organ donation means giving part of body (organ) to a person with end stage organ disease who needs a transplant. An organ is a part of the body that performs a specific function: like heart, lungs, kidney, liver etc. The organs that can be donated for transplantation include kidney,liver, heart, lungs, and small bowel and tissues such as corneas, heart valves, skinandbone. Tissue means a group of cells performing a particular function in the human bodysuch as bone, skin, cornea of the eye, heart valve, blood vessels, nerves and tendon etc.</p>
                            <h2>Legal Framework In India</h2>
                            <p>Organ donation in India is regulated by the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994. The law allows both deceased and living donors to donate their organs. It also identifies brain death as a form of death. The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) functions as the apex body for activities of relating to procurement, allotment and distribution of organs in the country. Although India has performed the second largest number of transplants in the world in 2019 (after United States), it lags far behind the western nations like Spain(35.1 pmp), United States (21.9 pmp) and United Kingdom(15.5 pmp) innational donation with a donation rate of only 0.65 per million population (2019) due to its hugepopulation. According to the World Health Organization, only around 0.01 percent of people in India donate their organs after death. Some of the reasons behindsuchpoorperformance are lack of public awareness, religious or superstitious beliefs among people, and strict laws.</p>
                            
                            <h1>Types of Donors</h1>
                            <p>Organ donors can be living or dead. The type of organ donations are as follows:</p>
                            
                                <li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <h2>Living Donors</h2>
                                        <p>Living donors are permitted to donate the following:</p>
                                        <li>
                                            <ul><p> > One of their kidneys</p></ul>
                                            <ul><p> > Portion of pancreas</p></ul>
                                            <ul><p> > Part of the liver</p></ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <p>Living donors must be over 18 years of age and are limited to donating only to their immediate blood relatives or, in some special cases, out of affection and attachment towards the recipient.</p>
                                    </ul>
                            
                                    <ul>
                                        <h4>Types of Living Donors</h4>
                            
                                        <h6>Living Near Related Donors:</h6>
                                        <p>Only immediate blood relations are accepted usually as donors viz., parents, siblings, children, grand parents and grand children (THOA Rules 2014). Spouse is also accepted as a living donor in the category of near relative and is permitted to be a donor.</p>
                            
                                        <h6>Living Non- near relative Donors:</h6>
                                        <p>are other than near relative of recipient or patient. They can donate only for the reason of affection andattachment towards the recipient or for any other special reason</p>
                            
                                        <h6>SWAP Donors:</h6>
                                        <p>In those cases, where the living near-relative donor is incompatible with the recipient, provision for swapping of donors between two such pairs exists, when donor of first pair matches with the second recipient and donor of second pair matches with the first recipient This is permissible only for near relatives as donors.</p>
                            
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                        <h2>Deceased Donors :</h2>
                                        <p>Deceased donor is anyone, regardless of age, race or gender can become an organ and tissue donor after his or her Death (Brainstem/Cardiac). Consent of near relative or a person in lawful possession of the dead body is required. If the deceased donor is under the age of 18 years, then the consent required from one of the parent or any near relative authorized by the parents is essential. Medical suitability for donation is determined at the time of death. Deceased donors may donate six life-saving organs: kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, and intestine. Uterus transplant is also performed, but it is not regarded as a life-saving organ. Organs and tissues from a person declared legally dead can be donated after consent from the family has been obtained. Brainstem death is also recognized as a form of death in India, as in many other countries. After a natural cardiac death, organs that can be donated are cornea, bone, skin, and blood vessels,whereas after brainstem death about 37 different organs and tissues can be donated,including the above six life-saving organs.</p>
                                    </ul>

                                <h2>Organ Transplant</h2>
                                <p>Organ transplant is a medical procedure where one organ removed from one person and placed in the body of recipient. Donor vital organs such as the heart, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and lungs can be transplanted to those whose organs are failing known as recipient/receiver.</p>
                            
                                <h2>Green Corridors</h2>
                                <p>Studies have suggested that the chances of the transplantation being successful are enhanced by reducing the time delay between harvest and transplant of the organ. Therefore, transportation of the organ is a critical factor. For this purpose, "greencorridors" have been created in many parts of India. A "green corridor" refers to a route that is cleared out for an ambulance carrying the harvested organs to ensure it's delivery at the destination in the shortest time possible. The hospitals involved in a transplantation, city traffic authorities, and in certain cases, airport authorities collaborate to transport an organ from one hospital to the next. The formal name of "green corridor" was given in July 2014 when a hospital and police in Chennai coordinated to transport a heart from one hospital to another in half the regular time.The system has been used effectively in cities such as Mumbai, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Indore.</p>
                                <p>Green corridors are generally used for transporting heart and liver, which have the shortest preservation times of four to six and 12 to 15 hours, respectively. The means of transportation is often by road, but air ambulances are also employed when the organs require transportation to different cities or states. Usage of greencorridors expedites organ transplantations while also ensuring that there is no organ wastage.But the process of setting up a green corridor is complex, since it requires coordination of multiple stakeholders. Due to the inconvenience to the public when using roads for this purpose, more prevalent usage of air ambulances or drones has been suggested to the government.</p>

                                <p>For many, the idea of organ donation can be scary or confusing. Various myths about the process can deter people from signing up to give the lifesaving gift of their organs. The current system of organ donation consists of 6 major phases of organ donation as mentioned below.</p>
                                <li>
